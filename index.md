# Welcome to DeepSweep.ai

**Cognitive Security for the Age of Superintelligence**

DeepSweep.ai is the first cybersecurity platform built from the ground up to protect **intelligent systems**, not just infrastructure.

Our platform is purpose-built for:
- AI agents
- Federated model meshes
- Autonomous cognitive pipelines
- Explainability, forensics, and compliance-by-design

---

## 🔐 Why It Matters

Legacy cybersecurity doesn’t protect model drift, memory injection, or adversarial evolution.

DeepSweep.ai introduces a **cognitive firewall**, integrating:
- AgentMesh™ orchestration
- Gr00t Sentinel Layer
- Explainable Thought Trace Logging (ETTL)
- Self-Patching Intelligence Mesh
- IC-SECURE: our zero-trust memory & communication fabric
